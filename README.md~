# Association-rule-learning
Introduce the Python implementation of Association rule learning, including Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm
## Apriori algorithm
Apriori uses a breadth-first search strategy to count the support of itemsets and uses a candidate generation function which exploits the downward closure property of support.
### Run by
```
python Apriori.py input_file.csv result_file sigma row_size
```
Here I prepare a 20k transaction file as our example input.
